**KEYBOARDS:**
<br>
**DESKTOP-->**
<br>
Desktop mainly divided into three parts- 1. Computation 2.Storage 3. Network

**COMUTATION:-**
<br>
<BR>
(i) *CPU*(Central Processing Unit): The primary processor that executes instructions. It is used for interpretation, processes and executions often to referred to as the "brain" of the computer.
<br>
(ii) *GPU*(Graphics Processing Unit): It is a specialized processor that handles rendering graphics and visual effects, essential for gaming and multimedia applications. It performs mathematical calculations at high speed.
<br>
(iii) *DPU*(Data Processing Unit): It perform as a helper for CPU by taking over it's networking and communication workloads.
<BR>
(iv) *TPU*(Tensor Processing Unit)-> It is a Google's custom-developed application-specific integrated circuits(ASICs) used to accelerate machine learning workloads.

**SOC ( SYSTEM ON A CHIP)-**
<BR>
A System on Chip or an SoC is an integrated circuit that incorporates a majority of components present on a computer.The beauty of an SoC is that it integrates all the components on a single substrate. In semiconductors, a substrate is a thin film of silicon used to fabricate integrated circuits. In contrast to the traditional motherboard, SoC integrates the replaceable components onto a single chip, thereby reducing the size and increasing efficiency.

<BR>
**STORAGE**
<BR>
1.*Primary storage*- (or main memory) is used for temporary data storage that the CPU needs to access quickly.
<BR>
2.*Secondary Storage*- is used for long-term data retention and has a much larger capacity compared to primary storage. It is non-volatile, meaning it retains data even when the power is off.e.g.hard disk,CD
<BR>
<BR>
**NETWORK**
<br>
(i) *Local Area Network (LAN)*- A LAN is a network that connects computers and other devices within a limited geographic area, such as a home, office building, or school.
<br>
(ii) *Wide Area Network (WAN)*- A telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area, often spanning cities, countries, or even continents.
<BR>
<BR>
**OPERATING SYSTEM(OS)**
<BR>
 An Operating system is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. it act as an intermediary between users and computer hardware
