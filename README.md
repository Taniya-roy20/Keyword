**KEYBOARDS:**
<br>
**DESKTOP-->**
<br>
Desktop mainly divided into three parts- 1. Computation 2.Storage 3. Network
<BR>
<BR>
**COMUTATION:-**
<br>
<BR>
(i) *CPU*(Central Processing Unit): The primary processor that executes instructions. It is used for interpretation, processes and executions often to referred to as the "brain" of the computer.
<br>
(ii) *GPU*(Graphics Processing Unit): It is a specialized processor that handles rendering graphics and visual effects, essential for gaming and multimedia applications. It performs mathematical calculations at high speed.
<br>
(iii) *DPU*(Data Processing Unit): It perform as a helper for CPU by taking over it's networking and communication workloads.
<BR>
(iv) *TPU*(Tensor Processing Unit)-> It is a Google's custom-developed application-specific integrated circuits(ASICs) used to accelerate machine learning workloads.
<BR>
<BR>
**SOC ( SYSTEM ON A CHIP)-**
<BR>
A System on Chip or an SoC is an integrated circuit that incorporates a majority of components present on a computer.The beauty of an SoC is that it integrates all the components on a single substrate. In semiconductors, a substrate is a thin film of silicon used to fabricate integrated circuits. In contrast to the traditional motherboard, SoC integrates the replaceable components onto a single chip, thereby reducing the size and increasing efficiency.
<BR>
<BR>
**STORAGE**
<BR>
1.*Primary storage*- (or main memory) is used for temporary data storage that the CPU needs to access quickly.
<BR>
2.*Secondary Storage*- is used for long-term data retention and has a much larger capacity compared to primary storage. It is non-volatile, meaning it retains data even when the power is off.e.g.hard disk,CD
<BR>
<BR>
**NETWORK**
<br>
(i) *Local Area Network (LAN)*- A LAN is a network that connects computers and other devices within a limited geographic area, such as a home, office building, or school.
<br>
(ii) *Wide Area Network (WAN)*- A telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area, often spanning cities, countries, or even continents.
<BR>
<BR>
**OPERATING SYSTEM(OS)**
<BR>
 An Operating system is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. it act as an intermediary between users and computer hardware.
 <BR>
 The famous or commonly used Operating System(OS):
 <BR>
 (i)*WINDOWS* 
 <BR>
 (ii)*MACos* 
 <br>
 (iii)*LINUX-* It is a open source operating system made by Linus torvalds came under UNIX(uniplexed information computer system).
 <BR>
 It has two types of families:-
 <BR>
 :Debian - it contains operating system like UBUNTU
 <BR>
 :RHEL - It contain operating system like centOS,oracle,fedora,red hat
 <br>
 <br>
 **NIC**
 <br>
 A network interface card, also known as NIC or network interface controller,is typically a circuit board installed on the computer to connect to the network. It works as an indispensable component for the network connection of computers.NIC cards designed as a built-in style are commonly found in most computers and some network servers. Besides, NIC cards like server NICs can also be inserted into expansion slots of devices.
 <BR>
 <BR>
 **CLOUD COMPUTING**
 <BR>
 It is the delivery of computing services- including servers,storage,databases,network,software etc. This allows for faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
 <BR>
 <BR> 
 **BARE METAL SYSTEM**
 <br>
 Bare metal refers to a computer system or servers that runs without a layer of abstraction such as a virtulization layer or operating system. This means that the software running on the system has direct access to the hardware resources, such as the CPU, memory, and Input/Output devices.
 <BR>
 <br>
 **BLOCKCHAIN**
 <br>
 A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain, with each additional block linking to the ones before it.
 <BR>
 <BR>
 *CISC[complex instruction set computer]*: It is a computer architecture in which single instructions can execute several low level operations or are capable of multi step operations or addressing modes within single instructions. 
 <BR>
 <BR>
 *RISC[reduced instruction set computer]*: It is a type of microprocessor architecture that utilizes a small,highly optimised set of instructions rather than highly-specialized set of instructions typically found in architecture.
 <BR>
 <BR>
 *RISC-V*: It is a open source instruction set architecture used to develop custom processors for a variety of applications.
 <BR>
 <BR>
 *ASIC(APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUIT)*: It is an integrated circuit that's custom designed for a particular task or application.
 <BR>
 <BR>
 *ARM(Advanced RISC Machine)*
 <BR>
 <BR>
 **VIRTUAL MACHINE**
 <BR>
 It is the virtualization or emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide the functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of the two. VMs provide isolation, encapsulation, and resource efficiency, making them valuable for development, testing, and production environments. They come in two main types: system virtual machines, which emulate entire systems, and process virtual machines, which abstract individual applications.
