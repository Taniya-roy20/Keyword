**SOC ( SYSTEM ON A CHIP)-**
<BR>
A System on Chip or an SoC is an integrated circuit that incorporates a majority of components present on a computer.The beauty of an SoC is that it integrates all the components on a single substrate. In semiconductors, a substrate is a thin film of silicon used to fabricate integrated circuits. In contrast to the traditional motherboard, SoC integrates the replaceable components onto a single chip, thereby reducing the size and increasing efficiency.
<BR>
<BR>
**STORAGE**
<BR>
1.*Primary storage*- (or main memory) is used for temporary data storage that the CPU needs to access quickly.
<BR>
2.*Secondary Storage*- is used for long-term data retention and has a much larger capacity compared to primary storage. It is non-volatile, meaning it retains data even when the power is off.e.g.hard disk,CD
<BR>
<BR>
**NETWORK**
<br>
(i) *Local Area Network (LAN)*- A LAN is a network that connects computers and other devices within a limited geographic area, such as a home, office building, or school.
<br>
(ii) *Wide Area Network (WAN)*- A telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area, often spanning cities, countries, or even continents.
<BR>
<BR>
**OPERATING SYSTEM(OS)**
<BR>
 An Operating system is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. it act as an intermediary between users and computer hardware.
 <BR>
 The famous or commonly used Operating System(OS):
 <BR>

 <br>
 <br>
 **NIC**
 <br>
 A network interface card, also known as NIC or network interface controller,is typically a circuit board installed on the computer to connect to the network. It works as an indispensable component for the network connection of computers.NIC cards designed as a built-in style are commonly found in most computers and some network servers. Besides, NIC cards like server NICs can also be inserted into expansion slots of devices.

 **VIRTUAL MACHINE**
 <BR>
 It is the virtualization or emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide the functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of the two. VMs provide isolation, encapsulation, and resource efficiency, making them valuable for development, testing, and production environments. They come in two main types: system virtual machines, which emulate entire systems, and process virtual machines, which abstract individual applications.
 <br>
 <br>

VPN is a set of technologies which are used to link computers to create a private network. Another network is used to carry the data, which is encrypted. The carrier network will see the packets of data which it routes. To the users of the VPN, it will look like the computers were directly connected to each other. When you use a VPN, your internet traffic is routed through a secure server before reaching its destination, adding a layer of privacy and security. However, it's important to choose a reputable VPN provider to ensure your data is handled securely and your privacy is protected.
<br>
<br>
**DNS(Domain Name System):**
<br>
It is a server responsible for keeping the file that contains information about the domain name and corresponding IP addresses as well as to provide information about the domain name and IP address during the DNS query. Like (www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1).
<BR>
<BR>
**FRONTEND,BACKEND AND API(Application Programming Interface)**
<BR>
In web development, the terms frontend, backend, and API refer to different aspects of building and managing applications:
<BR>
<BR>
*FRONTEND:* Frontend refers to the client-side of a web application. It encompasses everything that users interact with directly in their web browsers. It is the development of the graphical user interface of a website through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so users can view and interact with that website.
<br>
<br>
*BACKEND:* Backend refers to the server-side of a web application. It involves everything that happens on the server and is responsible for managing and processing data.
<BR>
<BR>
*API:* An application programming interface is a way for two or more computer programs or components to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation. Whereas a system's user interface dictates how its end-users interact with the system in question, its API dictates how to write code that takes advantage of that system's capabilities.APIs can be used to connect Frontend and Backend.

**The 7 layers of OSI model:**
<BR>
<BR>
#:-Layer 7 : (Application Layer) - The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and email clients.
<BR>
<BR>
#:-Layer 6 : (Presentation Layer )- The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. It defines how two devices should encode, encrypt, and compresses data so it is received correctly on the other end.
<BR>
<BR>
#:-Layer 5 : (Session Layer )- The session layer creates communication channels, called sessions, between devices.
<BR>
<BR>
#:-Layer 4 : (Transport Layer )- The transport layer takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into “segments” on the transmitting end.
<BR>
<BR>
#:-Layer 3 : ((Networking Layer) - The network layer has two main functions. One is breaking up segments into network packets, and reassembling the packets on the receiving end.
<BR>
<BR>
#:-Layer 2 : (Data-Link-Layer) - The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two physically-connected nodes on a network.
<BR>

**HYPERVISOR**:
<br>
A program used to run and manage two or more virtual machine on a single physical machine. It's also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM).
<br>
<br>
There are two types of HYPERVISOR:- 
<br>
<br>
**TYPE 1**
<BR>
Also known as a bare-metal or native hypervisor, this type of hypervisor runs directly on the host's hardware. It's more secure and stable than Type 2 hypervisors, and is often used in enterprise data centers and server-based environments. Type 1 hypervisors can implement their own resource allocation strategies for virtual machines (VMs). Examples of Type 1 hypervisors include Microsoft Hyper-V, VMware vSphere, and KVM.
<BR>
<BR>
**TYPE 2**
<BR>
Also known as a hosted hypervisor, this type of hypervisor runs on top of an operating system as a software layer or application. Type 2 hypervisors are easier to install, configure, and use than Type 1 hypervisors, and are more user-friendly. However, Type 2 hypervisors are less efficient than Type 1 hypervisors because they negotiate resource allocation with the operating system. Examples of Type 2 hypervisors include VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop.
